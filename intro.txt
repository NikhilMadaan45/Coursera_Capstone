The aim of this project is to find suitable locations to open a gym in New York, USA. One of
the main requirements to open a new gym is that it should be easily accessible by customers
and it should be located near a metro station. As New York is known as city of dreams, it is
very important to eliminate any kind of competition in order to flourish the business. So, we
also look into the number of gyms already existing in an area before setting up Gym. This
project can be utilized by any stakeholders/entrepreneur who would want to set up their
business in a new city. It can serve as stepping stone to start their business. To achieve the
above mentioned tasks, python geolocation libraries will used along with the Foursquare API.
Also, in order to create clusters of similar candidate locations, the K-means machine learning
clustering algorithm will be used.
